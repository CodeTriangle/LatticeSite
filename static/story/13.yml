title: 'Chapter 13: The End'

content: |
    I remember where I was when place ended. I was at work trying to balance keeping the lattice running and actually doing work. We were just trying to keep the lattice clean. I was watching r/place on the computer and suddenly the post showed up. Place has ended. Discord flooded with people saying it was over. A sense of dread immediately hit me. I hastily looked at the canvas. I had to see what our banner looked like. A wave of relief rushed over me, our banner was perfectly legible! We did it! We made our mark on history! People logged in after the fact and you could see their sadness that place was over. We did it though, we survived an entire weekend.
