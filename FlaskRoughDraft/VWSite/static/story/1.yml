title: 'Chapter 1: The Intro'

    First, there was nothing. White. An expanse of emptiness. Then the floodgates
    opened. Color flooded the canvas. Immediately a little green grid formed.
    Order in the face of such immense chaos. We started small, a collection of
    dark and light green pixels on a white background, immediately against the
    east border of the canvas. Two communities formed claiming to represent the
    canvas, r/the_grove and r/greenlattice. Early on they maintained similar
    subscriber numbers. After it was made apparent that r/greenlattice was the
    more populous sub, a merger occurred. CSS was designed, a Discord created,
    people started joining, a movement was started.

    We decided we need principles, we needed a goal, and we needed rules to live
    by. So we created the initial tenets of the green lattice:
    </br>
    </br>
    Rule 1: We protect art. We knew this was meant for art, and we would work our
        hardest to protect our other artists at all costs.
    </br>
    </br>
    Rule 2: No bots. This was a movement that had to be done by the people and for
        the people. Bots ruined the spirit of the place
    </br>
    </br>
    Rule 3: We will not aggress against anyone. We are a peaceful group and we
        feel that aggression only leads to neverending conflict and destruction of our
        lands.
    </br>
    </br>
    Rule 4: Keep the Lattice clean. We are nothing without the lattice.
    </br>
    </br>
    Explosive growth. Our lattice grew to the largest it has ever been. We
    were the second largest continuous mass of color on the canvas. Blue had
    become a terrifying sea of color. Red had filled in to about half our size,
    green and purple about half that in their respective corners. The Rainbow
    road had dissected the canvas, The Void and the Erase The Place had both begun
    their efforts clost to the center. Other notable efforts were r/prequelmemes
    and their Darth Plagueis the Wise copypasta, The Heart Pattern, and a billion
    fucking flags.
